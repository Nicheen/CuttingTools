# CuttingTools
Welcome to the CuttingTools repository!

This repository hosts the datasets utilized in my thesis titled "Cutting Tool Container Inspection: Stereo vision and monocular artificial intelligence depth estimation at Sandvik Coromant" 

## About the Thesis
In my thesis, I explore the application of artificial intelligence, specifically monocular depth estimation techniques, in the domain of container inspection. By leveraging advanced Depth Anything a more robust container inspection method could be developed.

## Datasets
The datasets included here serve as the foundation for the research conducted in the thesis. The images noted with a "F" indicate that they are supposed to fail the inspection.

### Dataset Descriptions
- **Yellow**: Only Yellow metal cutting tools of different shapes and sizes.
- **Shiny**: Only reflective "shiny" metal cutting tools of different shapes and sizes.
- **Small**: Only the smallest of metal cutting tools are still in different shapes.
